# Power Electronics Laboratory Experiments Repository


## üìã Project Overview
Power electronics focuses on converting, controlling, and conditioning electrical power (AC ‚Üî DC, voltage/current regulation) using semiconductor devices (thyristors, MOSFETs, IGBTs). 

This repository accompanies a standard power electronics lab curriculum, covering core topologies like:
- Rectifiers (uncontrolled/controlled AC ‚Üí DC)
- AC Voltage Controllers
- Cycloconverters (AC ‚Üí lower-frequency AC)
- DC-DC Converters (Buck/Boost/Buck-Boost)
- Inverters (DC ‚Üí AC, with/without PWM)



## üß™ Experiment List (Lab Curriculum)
The experiments are organized by topology type, with clear learning outcomes for each category. Key terms (e.g., *SCR*, *PWM*, *RL Load*) are explained for new learners.
